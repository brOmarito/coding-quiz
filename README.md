# coding-quiz
The following project is a coding quiz on JavaScript principles. The technologies used in the project are: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of the things I introduced which I personally liked was shuffling the questions and answers so they're not always in the same order. I also made it flexible to continue adding various questions just by altering the array.

## What are the rules?
1. You have 120 seconds to finish the quiz
2. You get 10 points for each right answer
3. You lose 10 seconds when you answer a question incorrectly
4. At the end, your remaining time gets added to you score
5. The top 5 scores of your local storage get saved

## What was the point?
The main point of this project was to continue getting practice in JavaScript. To be more specific, practice using vanilla JavaScript. Not only this but to continue getting practice using vanilla HTML and CSS.

## Lessons Learned
I got a lot of experience working with adding event listeners. THat would probably be my biggest takeaway from this exercise. That and playing around with hiding and displaying elements. For some situations, that is not the ideal way of handling them but since I'm relatively new to JavaScript and wanted to have this done by a certain day, that was the quickest path for me.

## Improvements
* One of the areas I would change is with some of the formatting. I was mainly focused on functionality and therefore my styling suffered.
* I would like to play around with having separate card elements for each question and answer pair, then playing around with effects of switching between the cards.
* I would have liked to import a separate JS file to hold the array but did not set up the architecture for that this time around.
